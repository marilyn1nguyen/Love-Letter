# Love-Letter
By Marilyn Nguyen

A 2-4 player pass-and-play terminal based game.

# Object of the game:
In the wake of the arrest of Queen Marianna for high treason, none was more heartbroken than her daughter, Princess Annette. 
Suitors throughout the City-State of Tempest sought to ease Annette's sorrow by courting her to bring some joy into her life.

You are one of these suitors, trying to get your love letter to the princess. 
Unfortunately, she has locked herself in the palace, so you must rely on intermediaries to carry your message.
During the game, you hold one secret card in your hand. This is who currently carries your message of love for the princess.

Make sure that the person closest to the princess holds your love letter at the end of the day, so it reaches her first!
